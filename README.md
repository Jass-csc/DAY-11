üß† What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML means using HTML elements according to their meaning, not just their appearance.

Instead of using generic tags like <div> and <span> for everything, semantic HTML uses descriptive tags like <header>, <article>, <footer>, etc., which give meaning to the structure of your page.
‚úÖ Why Use Semantic HTML?

    üì± Improves accessibility (screen readers can understand your page better)

    üîç SEO-friendly (search engines better understand your content)

    üßπ Cleaner, more readable code

    üîß Easier to maintain
